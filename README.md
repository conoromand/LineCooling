# LineCooling
Lists of line cooling power from nebular spectral models from Omand and Jerkstrand (2023).  Described in Omand (2025).

Seperate files contain the lists at each epoch.  
The first three columns in each list give the model properties (L_PWN, M_ej, and T_PWN) in the units listed.
The fourth column has the log of the dipolar component of the pulsar magnetic field in gauss.
The rest of the columns are different transitions between 1000 angstrom and 100 um.  The number for each model is the cooling power of that transition at the given epoch.

For model information about these transitions and their implications, see Omand (2025).
For more information about the models and their assumptions, see Omand and Jerkstrand (2023). (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...673A.107O/abstract)
